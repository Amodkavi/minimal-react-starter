Minimal React Starter
---

A starter project with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

Okay so this could be more minimal. You can use React without either Babel or Webpack... but they are too useful to pass up in any project.

Runs on the `webpack-dev-server`, which hosts your assets and compiles your Javascript.


Setup
---

`npm install`


Usage
---

```
npm start
open http://localhost:8080/
```
